# Recovery Threshold Analysis (MLOps Hands-On)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer recovery strategies around a financial threshold using
statistical tests and regression modeling. The goal is to understand whether different
recovery strategies lead to significantly different outcomes near a cutoff point.

## Problem Statement
Customers are assigned recovery strategies based on their expected recovery amount.
This project evaluates whether crossing a threshold (e.g., $1000) results in a measurable
change in actual recovery outcomes.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Non-parametric statistical tests (Kruskal–Wallis, Chi-square)
- Linear regression with threshold indicator
- Reproducible ML pipeline using DVC
- Experiment tracking using MLflow

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- DVC (Data Version Control)
- MLflow (Experiment Tracking)
- DAGsHub (Unified ML Platform)

## Project Status
🚧 Under active development as part of an end-to-end MLOps hands-on exercise.
